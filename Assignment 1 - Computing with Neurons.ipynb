    "\n",
    "Before installation, you will need a computer that has Python and the Python library NumPy installed.  On Linux, these should be available with your favourite package manager.  On OS X and Windows, we recommend installing Anaconda (a Python distribution that comes with a lot of extra packages, including NumPy).  The Python version can be 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5.  If you do not have a preference among those versions, we tend to most commonly use 2.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have this installed, download the latest version of Nengo and Nengo GUI using the following links:\n",

    " - https://github.com/nengo/nengo/archive/master.zip\n",
    " - http://github.com/nengo/nengo_gui/archive/master.zip\n",
    " \n",
    "Unzip these files into their separate directories (```nengo``` and ```nengo_gui```).  Alternatively, if you are familiar with ```git``` you can use it to download these repositories from http://github.com/nengo/nengo and http://github.com/nengo/nengo_gui\n",
    "\n",
    "Go into the ```nengo``` directory and run ```python setup.py develop --user```.  This should install Nengo.  Now go into the ```nengo_gui``` directory and run ```python setup.py develop --user```.  This should install the Nengo GUI.  You should now be able to run the Nengo GUI by running ```nengo_gui```.\n",

For this first assignment, look through tutorials 00 through 10.  This provides both a reminder of some of the things discussed in class and example code that provides the required programming syntax."
