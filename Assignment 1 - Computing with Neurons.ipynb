If you are not familiar with installing these, we recommend installing Anaconda, which is a Python distribution that comes with a lot of extra packages, including NumPy.  It is available here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual\n",

For this first assignment, look through tutorials 00 through 10.  This provides both a reminder of some of the things discussed in class and example code that provides the required programming syntax."
